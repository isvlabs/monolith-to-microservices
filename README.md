## Introduction
### Breaking apart a monolith (TBD)
To be updated ---  Monolith to Microservices for SaaS working example - Initially written for an ISV immersion day

## Outcomes
1. Instrumenting to understanding the source monolith
2. Decoupling the data model
3. Approaches to decomposing an application monolith
4. Migrating services off monolith (introducing a container approach a la ECS)
5. Security model / monolith vs many services (e.g. separation of roles)

### Let's get started
1. [Part One: Monolith setup, deployment and hosting ()
2. [Part Two: Database target config and setup ()
3. [Part Three: Breaking the monolith apart into microservices on ECS] ()
4. [Part Four: Update the monolith to talk to the new target microservices] ()
5. [Part Five: Next steps, Where to from here ?] ()
